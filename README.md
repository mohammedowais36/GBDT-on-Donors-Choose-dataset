# GBDT-on-Donors-Choose-dataset
Gradient-boosted decision trees are a machine learning technique for optimizing the predictive value of a model through successive steps in the learning process. This project involves in implementation of Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, GBDT algorithms on Donor choose dataset. The goal is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.
